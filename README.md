# TCP_controlPID

This project implements a PID control to the temperature of a resistor. It was done during a subject in the university.

The control is monitored by a LCD display and a TCP/IP communication can also have access to the data and control the setpoint. Beyond that, in the offline mode, the setpoint can also be set by a keypad
